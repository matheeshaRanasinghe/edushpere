run the rag.py first to create the vector database
and the run the main.py
add the Gemini api keys to the main.py
then when the main.py is running 
go to your browser and go to the local address shown in the output of the main.py while the main.py is running 

all the pages in the app is functional 

i didn't have time to clean up the code
so there is no comments in some places
and some libraries are imported
even they are not important
